                        <h5>SELLING PRACTICES</h5>

                        <p>Setting clear buyer expectations and then meeting or
                        exceeding them is a great way to make your buyer happy
                        and ensure a smooth transaction.</p>

                        <p>Some of the simplest things you can do are to
                        provide accurate and consistent details about your item
                        and to be clear and specific about the terms and
                        conditions of the sale.</p>

                        <p>You should also make every effort to provide
                        excellent customer service from start to finish,
                        including:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Charging reasonable shipping and handling
                            costs</li>

                            <li>Specifying your handling time and return policy
                            in your listing</li>

                            <li>Responding to buyers' questions promptly</li>

                            <li>Being professional throughout the
                            transaction</li>

                            <li>Making sure the item is delivered to the buyer
                            as described in your listing</li>

                            <li>Frequently reviewing and updating listings to
                            make sure all information—such as inventory status
                            and item condition—is accurate and up to date</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Be sure to follow the guidelines in this policy. If
                        you don't, your listings may be removed and you may be
                        subject to a range of other actions, including
                        restrictions of your buying and selling privileges and
                        suspension of your account. The listing page is where
                        buyers get most of their information about an item.
                        Information in the listing helps buyers decide what to
                        buy and know what to expect when they receive an item.
                        It's important to make sure that the listing is only
                        used to describe the item for sale and to communicate
                        the terms of the sale in a professional way. You're
                        required to:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Specify the condition of the item</li>

                            <li>Describe any defects or flaws in the item—this
                            helps avoid problems or buyer dissatisfaction</li>

                            <li>Note: When selling a used, refurbished, or
                            flawed item, you must include photos of the actual
                            item for sale instead of a stock photo</li>

                            <li>Specify shipping costs and related service
                            charges in your listings</li>

                            <li>Let buyers know when they can expect to get
                            their items</li>

                            <li>Do whatever you can to provide excellent
                            customer service. Meeting or exceeding buyers'
                            expectations can help you improve your performance
                            on CollegiateZone.org</li>

                            <li>Seller agrees to Terms and Conditions in this
                            document while using CollegiateZone.org.</li>
                        </ul>
